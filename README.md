# Autobinning
Processing of microscope images and autobinning of them for subsequent analysis

This is a work in progress translation to python from code published in https://doi.org/10.1002/stem.3448.

The idea is to facilitate the use of the method of autobinning - making the code more clear as well as extending it with some quality of life functionality.
